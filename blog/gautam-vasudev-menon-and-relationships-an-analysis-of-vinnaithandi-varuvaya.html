                <p>Take any relationship- be it between a parent and one's kids, that with one's friends, or colleagues etc., Any contact between two humans has got lot of intricacies and nuances. But nothing can beat the complexity more than a relationship that blossoms between a man and a woman who intends to share their life with each other. When it comes to movies, primarily to Tamil cinema, I would say Gautham Vasudev Menon(GVM) is one of those rarest directors who has wielded these emotions wonderfully and has approached the relationship 'Love' in a multi-dimensional way. I recently watched Vinnaithandi Varuvaaya(VTV) in theater, which was re-released after its original release in 2010 and watching that movie is the trigger point for this post.</p>
                <p>If one analyses the movies he has directed starting from his debut, which is Minnale, one can observe that Love in his movies are never abusive. The Love may fall apart but the lovers would still wish each other the best, though they may reel from despair, which makes me respect GVM. You may wonder as to what is so different about this approach as this quality is just an exhibition of inner goodness that all humans are expected to possess by default.</p>
