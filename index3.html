                            Hello! Welcome to Sammy's MindChirps. I'm glad you are here. To me, the word LIFE is an acronym of Laboratory with Infinite Freedom to Experiment. It's more like a kaleidoscope offering amazing learning opportunities as we grow and explore various facets of life. So this blog is a platform where I share anything that I find interesting (with my two cents, of course :D). I assure that you will have some new learning when you exit the blog. And do share your feedback on the blog or anything you want me to write about in this blog by dropping an email to mindchirps@gmail.com

Communication is the lifeline of any relationship- be it personal or professional. Interestingly, while our educational system prepares us for communication in a formal setting - such as delivering a presentation, writing clear emails, rehearsed conversations etc., it doesn’t coach us for speaking in an informal setting...",

It is loaded with lot of contrarian feelings- you need the person you love to be possessive about you yet need your space; you need that person to respect your thoughts and let you do things on your course yet you want that person to offer their unsolicited views, and I could go on and on about how this universal feeling called \"LOVE\" is so unfathomable. Perhaps, this is why, no matter how many movies are done around the central theme of love, new ones with fresh perspective like \"Lover\" still is celebrated by the audience.",

This is a stereotypical theme, which Kollywood audience are used to from the days of Sigappu Rojakkal but the director has navigated through the plot with rich twists and tight screenplay, maintaining the suspense all through the movie.",

Some crisis could impact self while some like Covid 19 could impact people at large. Darwin's theory of evolution talks about survival of the fittest, which emphasizes on the adaptablity to the adverse situations as a quintessential quality to live to see another day. This theory is very much and all the more relevant in present scenario given the VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) nature of the world. But what are the essential qualities, you may wonder. Thanks to the authors T N Hari and Sanjay Swami...",

                excerpt: "Take any relationship- be it between a parent and one's kids, that with one's friends, or colleagues etc., Any contact between two humans has got lot of intricacies and nuances. But nothing can beat the complexity more than a relationship that blossoms between a man and a woman who intends to share their life with each other. When it comes to movies, primarily to Tamil cinema, I would say Gautham Vasudev Menon(GVM) is one of those rarest directors who has wielded these emotions wonderfully and has approached the relationship 'Love' in a multi-dimensional way. I recently watched Vinnaithandi Varuvaaya(VTV) in theater, which was re-released after its original release in 2010 and watching that movie is the trigger point for this post. If one analyses the movies he has directed starting from his debut, which is Minnale, one can observe that Love in his movies are never abusive. The Love may fall apart but the lovers would still wish each other the best, though they may reel from despair, which makes me respect GVM. You may wonder as to what is so different about this approach as this quality is just an exhibition of inner goodness that all humans are expected to possess by default.",

                excerpt: "The movie's storyline is very straight forward: How travel can change one's outlook about life. Of late, in Kollywood cinema, this pattern can be seen where there is a depressed person(men, mostly) who would climb on their Royal Enfield bike and then set off to the Himalayan mountains; when they return, they become a refined soul. So, is this movie any different from the stereotypical portrayal?!",
